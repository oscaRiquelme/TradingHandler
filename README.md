# TradingHandler

This project is my first github project for c developing. 
It is intended to run in linux. 

It is a console application that helps me handle my moves when trading the stock market.

When executed, it shows a menu with options to handle:
  your pending trades (those that may be executed in the future)
  your opened trades (those currently running)
  your history trades (those that have already been closed)

It also includes a calculator for a new trade that asks for some basic info like how much capital you want to risk and returns concepts like the amount of shares you should go for to accomplish your plan

Every type of trade (pending, opened, history) has its own variables and, when exiting the program, can be saved so that the next time you open the program, everything is there.
In the menu for every type of trade, you also have the possibility to generate and open with your default editor a file with all the info of all your trades of that type.
